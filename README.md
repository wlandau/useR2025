# Powerful simulation pipelines with {targets}

When designing clinical trials, simulations are essential for comparing options and optimizing features like sample size, allocation, randomization, milestones, and decision criteria. However, simulations require thousands of replications and long execution times. Pipeline tools bring efficiency, reproducibility, and peace of mind to demanding computations such as simulations. The `targets` package is a friendly workflow manager that brings the automation and structure of pipelines to the uniquely fluid and interactive environment where R users thrive. This talk explores `targets` with a simulation pipeline for an example clinical trial.
